What is stubbing? 

-The process of writing how a given mock method should behave is called "stubbing". you mock some dependency 
(by injecting the external component) and then set up some fixed values as you wish, and then assertTrue to see if
the value matches or not 
-give stubbing some pre-set-up values by using: 
--1. when() + thenReturn() 
--2. doReturn() + when()
